# Easybank landing page

## Description

This is the template of a landing page - a real-world project to work out and learn from. In this project, I was supposed to replicate the design and make it responsive for most devices. The languages I used for this project is HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript since I wanted to build a page without the help of any framework available.

## Project setup

Since it is a simple page, I put everything in the `public` folder for you to run in your local machine, no need for installing packages, just `Open with Live Server`.

## What I learned

This project helped me a lot in structuring a landing page, figuring out what to include in every section of the page and making it appealling to the eye. Also, I got to improve my CSS skill it was so hard to come up with numbers when comes to margins, padding, sizes.etc. All in all I had a great time making a 99%-look-alike page from the challenge.
